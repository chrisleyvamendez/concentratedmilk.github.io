      Shiba Inu is a breed of dog that originated in Japan 
      and has gained <strong>popularity</strong> around the world as a pet. 
      However, the term "Shiba Inu" is also commonly associated 
      with a cryptocurrency called Shiba Inu coin,
      which was created in August 2020 as a playful spin-off 
      of another cryptocurrency called Dogecoin. Shiba Inu coin is an ERC-20 token 
      that runs on the <strong>Ethereum</strong>
      blockchain and is designed to be a 
      decentralized and community-driven cryptocurrency. The coin's mascot is a 
      Shiba Inu dog, which has become a popular meme in the cryptocurrency world. 
      While Shiba Inu coin has seen a surge in popularity and trading volume, it is 
      important to note that cryptocurrencies are highly speculative and volatile assets, and 
      investing in them can be risky.
